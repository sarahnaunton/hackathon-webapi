# Cocktail Generator

This project was created during my first (6 hour) hackathon during week 5 of the software engineering bootcamp at BrainStation. The goal was to create a page and integrate a web API.

I developed a page that generates cocktail recipes. As someone who appreciates the flavours and creativity behind cocktails, I wanted to create a platform where users can explore a variety of cocktail recipes in a fun and engaging way. 
 



## Features


Users can either click a random generator button or select from a set number of cocktail options to view the name, ingredients, and instructions for a cocktail.


## Tech Stack

- Git and Terminal
- HTML5
- CSS/Sass
- JavaScript

## API Reference

- [Cocktail DB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

## Challenges
One of the main challenges I encountered during the development of this project was handling the returned data from the API. The JSON data provided by the API listed ingredients individually, with varying numbers for different cocktails. This required transforming the ingredients into an array and implementing a mechanism to handle cocktails with different numbers of ingredients. Through the use of control flow statements, I ensured that only valid ingredients were displayed on the webpage.

## Potential Enhancements

If I had had more time during the hackathon, other features I would have loved to incorporate include the option to convert the measurements into millilitres and making the website responsive to mobile and tablet devices.
## Moving Forward

With a greater appreciation and understanding for web APIs, I plan to continue exploring integrating other APIs in further projects during my bootcamp.
